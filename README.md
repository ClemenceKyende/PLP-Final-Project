**Empower Your Time, Master Your Productivity**

## Introduction

Welcome to TimeWise, your ultimate productivity and time management web app! TimeWise is designed to help you take control of your time and enhance your productivity levels, whether you're a student, professional, or someone simply looking to manage personal tasks more efficiently.


## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, but ensure it's installed (`npm --version` to check)
- **MongoDB**: 
  - For local development: [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
  - For cloud-based development: [Create a MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Setup Instructions

**Clone the Repository**


   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

**Create and Configure the `.env` File**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Ensure that the `.env` file is placed in the root directory of your project (i.e., the same directory where the `package.json` file is located).

   - Open the `.env` file and update the placeholders with your actual values:

     ```plaintext
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
     SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
     SMTP_PORT=587
     SMTP_USER=<your_smtp_user>
     SMTP_PASS=<your_smtp_password>
     PORT=5000
     ```

   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<database_name>`, `<your_jwt_secret>`, `<your_smtp_user>`, and `<your_smtp_password>` with your actual values.

**Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure you are in the project directory and install the necessary npm packages:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

**Run the Application**

   - Start the application using the following command:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   - The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

**Testing and Verification**

   - Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your web browser to ensure the application is running correctly.
   - Verify that the application is able to connect to MongoDB and other services by checking for any errors in the terminal or browser.

**Troubleshooting**

   - If you encounter issues, refer to the **Troubleshooting** section in this document for common problems and solutions.
   - Ensure all environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly set.
   - Check that all dependencies are installed and up to date.
